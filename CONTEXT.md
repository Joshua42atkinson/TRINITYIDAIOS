# Trinity ID AI OS — Research Bible & Session Context
## March 23, 2026 — Production Prototype v14.0.0 (Purdue LDT Portfolio Integration)

---

## 1. WHAT TRINITY IS

Trinity ID AI OS is a gamified instructional design system that helps K-12 teachers build educational games. It uses AI agents orchestrated through ADDIECRAPEYE (a 12-station instructional design lifecycle) to autonomously create games, lesson plans, and educational media.

**TRINITY = ID + AI + OS:**
- **ID = ADDIE** — Instructional Design backbone (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate)
- **AI = CRAP** — Visual Design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity)
- **OS = EYE** — Observer/Metacognition (Envision, Yoke, Evolve)

**The P-ART-Y Framework (Who operates Trinity):**
- **P = Pete** — The ONLY AI personality (Mistral Small 4 119B, single static RAM load, ~68GB)
- **A = Aesthetics** — Functional mode: CRAP visual design, ComfyUI assets (same brain, different prompt)
- **R = Research** — Functional mode: QM audits, tests, CI/CD, the Cow Catcher (same brain, different prompt)
- **T = Tempo** — Functional mode: Code gen, Bevy scaffolding, 30-second loop momentum (same brain, different prompt)
- **Y = You** — The Yardmaster. You manage the yard. Executive core. Delegates to P-ART.

**Architecture:** One brain, one static RAM load. ART modes are just different system prompts routed through Pete. Only Python services (ComfyUI, Voice) run as sidecars for crash isolation.

**The Iron Road is the hook. Productivity is the product.** Trinity needs to actually build games, not just look like it can.

## 2. THE "MEANING MAKING" TRACE (Isomorphic Alignment)

Trinity ensures functional alignment across every level of the system:

1. **AI Attention (HOW to attend)**: **Sacred Circuitry** (15 nodes) — internal scaffolding, de-emphasized in UI.
2. **User Preference (WHAT user prefers)**: **VAAM Bridge** (Profile + Word Weights) — 49 tests passing.
3. **Methodology (WHAT to do)**: **ADDIECRAPEYE** (12 stations) lifecycle — 18 tests passing.
4. **Identity (WHO the user is)**: **Character Sheet** (Skill Boosts per station completion).
5. **Academic Progress (HOW graduation is measured)**: **LDT Portfolio** — 12 portfolio artifacts mapped to ADDIECRAPEYE phases, QM alignment scoring, IBSTPI/ATD/AECT competency tracking, Gate Review graduation gate.

**Functional Flow:**
User Message → VAAM Bridge (Style/Vocab detect) → Pete Orchestration (VAAM + LDT Portfolio aligned) → Quest Objective Complete → Station Advance → **Portfolio Artifact Vaulted** → QM/Competency Recalculation → **Character Sheet Updated** (Coal/Steam/Friction physics + academic progress).

**The Isomorphism:** Purdue LDT program requirements are mapped 1:1 to Iron Road game physics. Completing an instructional design artifact is the same as adding coal to the locomotive. QM rubric alignment is the same as reducing track friction. Gate Review is the same as reaching the end of the Iron Road.

| **Yardmaster Tab** | ✅ IDE UPGRADE | 3-column layout: Quest Sidebar (phase/objectives/stats) \| Chat+Forge (center) \| System+Tools (right). Model Info Bar (live turn counter), collapsible Thinking Panel (<thinking> reasoning), continuation badge. `useYardmaster` hook: 256K context, 4K response tokens, 8 turns, SSE events (thinking/resources/skill/narrative), quest polling, model info. `cleanToolCalls()` strips raw JSON from display. |
| **Agent Prompt** | ✅ AUTONOMOUS | ACT FIRST for tasks, TALK for casual chat. [CONTINUE] multi-response chaining (3x). AUTONOMOUS WORK protocol: task_queue → work → complete → log → continue. 29 tools including work_log, task_queue, analyze_document, analyze_image, **scout_sniper**. **Dual persona**: 🔮 Great Recycler (visionary) / ⚙️ Programmer Pete (executor). |
| **Auto-Launch LLM** | ✅ BUILT | Trinity probes llama-server (8080) → LM Studio (1234) → vLLM (8000) → Ollama (11434) → auto-launches llama-server with Mistral GGUF if none found. Managed by `InferenceRouter`. |
| **Inference Router** | ✅ BUILT | Phase 3: `inference_router.rs` — auto-detects 6 backends (llama-server, vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio, SGLang, **Researcher**), health monitoring, failover, TOML config, 9 unit tests. |
| **EYE Export** | ✅ BUILT | `eye_container.rs` bundles quest data → `export.rs` generates self-contained HTML5 quiz, adventure, or raw JSON. Download buttons in UI. |
| **Onboarding Tour** | ✅ BUILT | 3-step tooltip overlay for first-time users. Highlights chat, objectives, export. localStorage-gated (shows once). |
| **In-Chat Images** | ✅ BUILT | `generate_image` tool → base64 SSE `event: image` → inline rendering in PhaseWorkspace and Yardmaster. |
| **Researcher (Qianfan-OCR)** | ✅ BUILT | `analyze_document` tool calls 4B Qianfan-OCR sub-agent on :8081. Document parsing, OCR, chart QA, KIE. 192 languages. |

| **work_log Tool** | ✅ BUILT | Agent writes timestamped markdown reports to `~/Workflow/trinity-reports/` for next-day EYE review. |
| **task_queue Tool** | ✅ BUILT | File-based task queue (`TASK_QUEUE.md`): read/add/complete/next actions for autonomous overnight work. |
| **python_exec Tool** | ✅ BUILT | Sandboxed Python execution: temp file, pip install, 60s timeout, output capture. Teachers use Python. |
| **Structured Tool Calling** | ✅ BUILT | Phase 2: OpenAI-compatible `tools` array in inference requests, `tool_calls` in responses. Agent tries structured first, falls back to regex. `--jinja` flag on all launch points. |
| **Educational Tools** | ✅ BUILT | 4 classroom-ready generators: `generate_lesson_plan` (Bloom's), `generate_rubric` (multi-criteria), `generate_quiz` (MC/TF/short), `curriculum_map` (weekly progression). |
| **Zombie Guard** | ✅ BUILT | `zombie_check` tool + automatic pre-build guard in `cargo_check`. Kills orphan rustc/cc processes before each build. Prevents stuck-build deadlocks. |
| **Tool Call Persistence** | ✅ BUILT | `trinity_tool_calls` PostgreSQL table logs every agent tool invocation with params, result, latency for analytics. |
| **Reasoning Mode** | ✅ BUILT | `reasoning_effort=high` on all Yardmaster turns. `<thinking>` tag extraction → streamed as SSE event. Pete chat passes None (stays fast). 300s timeout for reasoning-heavy tasks. |
| **Duality KV Cache** | ✅ BUILT | `id_slot` field on all inference requests. Persona→slot routing: Great Recycler=slot 0 (strategic), Programmer Pete=slot 1 (execution). llama-server runs with `--parallel 2`. Instant persona switching, 500K total context. |
| Forge Terminal | ✅ BUILT | Shows tool execution logs in Yardmaster tab (colored line types: command/success/error) |
| **3D Yard (Bevy)** | 🔶 PARKED | The blank canvas — user builds here. `trinity-bevy-graphics` archived (30K+ LOC). Blocked by winit 0.30.13 + Rust 1.94 type inference failure. Post-graduation. |
| Knowledge Tracing | ⏳ PARKED | Static SVG curve, hardcoded BKT values. Post-graduation research project. |
| RLHF Training | ⏳ PARKED | Feedback logged, not yet wired to retraining. Post-graduation. |

## 7. KEY DECISIONS

- **llama-server** serves Mistral Small 4 GGUF on `:8080` — the working brain (Vulkan, flash-attn on)
- **Auto-launch** — Trinity spawns llama-server automatically if none found on startup
- **Python voice pipeline** on `:7777` — wake word, ASR, TTS, agentic tools
- **OpenAI-compatible API** — both Rust server and voice pipeline talk to `:8080`
- **LLM_URL env var** — Trinity backend reads `LLM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080` for inference
- **Models evolve, Trinity adapts** — architecture is model-agnostic
- **PostgreSQL optional** — server starts without DB (uses `connect_lazy`), quest save disabled
- **No embedded inference for shipping** — HTTP to llama-server is the production path
- **Apache 2.0** — Permissive open source. Users own content built with Trinity.

### Bevy / winit Lessons (March 21, 2026)
- **Workspace Bevy version:** `bevy = "0.18.1"`, `bevy_egui = "0.39.1"` in root `Cargo.toml`
- **winit 0.30.13 + Rust 1.94.0 = 63 E0282 errors.** The `maybe_queue_on_main` / `maybe_wait_on_main` closures in winit lack type annotations that Rust 1.94's stricter inference needs. No fix released as of March 21, 2026 (winit 0.30.14 does not exist, 0.31.0-beta.2 exists but Bevy requires `^0.30`).
- **Fix:** `trinity-bevy-graphics` overrides workspace Bevy dep: `bevy = { version = "0.18.1", default-features = false, features = ["bevy_render", "bevy_asset", "bevy_color", "bevy_mesh"] }`. Excluding `bevy_winit` avoids the winit compile failure entirely. This works because the crate is a library (vision + mesh generation), not a window launcher.
- **When windowing is needed** (Bevy WASM `<canvas>` or desktop preview): either wait for winit 0.30.14+, or build WASM targets where winit behavior may differ, or pin an older Rust.
- **`trinity-sidecar`** exists in `crates/` (3,815 LOC) but is NOT in workspace members — intentionally excluded, may need cleanup or re-inclusion.

---

## 8. PROJECT GOALS

- **The Finish Line**: Close the gap on a full production prototype for Purdue.
- **Distribution**: ConsciousFramework.com, GreatRecycler.com.
- **Nonprofit Foundation**: Planned for maintenance, grants, and community.
- **CRITICAL**: Trinity must produce real work product (game designs, lesson plans, assets). The Iron Road is the UX hook — productivity is the deliverable.

> - **Edge Guard Middleware** — `edge_guard.rs`: defense-in-depth Cloudflare tunnel detection, route blocking (33 blocked prefixes), per-IP rate limiting (60/min), 8 unit tests
> - **Caddyfile Hardening** — Blocks all dangerous API routes (tools, chat, models, sessions, projects, creative, voice, admin), adds security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
> - **Localhost Bind** — Server bound to `127.0.0.1:3000` (was `0.0.0.0:3000`), only Cloudflare tunnel can reach it
> - **CORS Restriction** — `CorsLayer::permissive()` → allowlist (ldtatkinson.com, localhost)
> - **Health Endpoint H5** — Tunnel traffic gets `{"status":"healthy"}` only, no internal telemetry leaked
> - **Portfolio Redirect** — Tunnel `/` → `/portfolio/` (Purdue-approved LDT Portfolio, not Trinity UI)
> - **systemd Services** — `trinity.service`, `cloudflared.service`, `llama-server.service` (auto-start on boot, resource limits, security hardening)
> - **Identity Split (Tier 3.5)** — `AppState` decomposed into `PlayerContext` (character_sheet, bestiary, app_mode) + `ProjectContext` (game_state, conversation_history, book, book_updates, session_id). 24+ call sites migrated across 7 files. 205 tests passing.
> - **Maturation Map** — 5-tier roadmap (Tier 0-4) with acceptance criteria, Red Hat finding mapping, and Purdue statement draft


### THE PLAN: 1D-2D-3D Layered UI

The Iron Road (2D) scaffolds instructional design. The ART Canvas (Bevy desktop) is the
immersive creative sandbox. The AI automates design work but the user is in the loop
as EYE (Envision → Yoke → Evolve).

```
1D(Audio) feeds → 2D(Book) narrates → ART(Bevy) creates
ADDIE + CRAP    → Iron Road LitRPG  → Bevy ART canvas
Pete speaks     → Player reads/plays → Yardmaster builds
```

### TODO — Purdue Presentation Prep

#### 🔴 Priority 1: ART Canvas Polish (Next Session)
- [ ] Visual polish — color palette, particle tweaking, responsive layout
- [ ] Wire ART canvas to ComfyUI pipeline (image generation in Bevy window)
- [ ] Add lane-based rendering (text lane, image lane, audio lane)
- [ ] Connect ART control rail inputs to actual sidecar calls

#### 🟡 Priority 2: Pete System Prompt Integration
- [ ] Wire `generate_pete_system_prompt()` into `agent.rs` / `conductor_leader.rs`
- [ ] Test: Pete blocks artifact without defined outcomes (Action Mapping Mandate)
- [ ] Test: Pete invokes Heavilon Protocol on failed QM review
- [ ] Verify vulnerability-adaptive scaffolding (gentle vs. direct modes)

#### 🟢 Priority 3: End-to-End Verification
- [ ] Full 12-phase walkthrough: llama-server → Pete chat → all phases → GDD compile
- [ ] Portfolio artifact vaulting: POST artifact → verify QM recalculation → verify XP update
- [ ] Character Sheet HUD: verify all sections render with real data from /api/character
- [ ] Frontend build + deploy: `npm run build` → serve from `frontend/dist/`

#### 🔵 Priority 4: Full Documentation Review (After ART)
- [ ] TRINITY_FANCY_BIBLE.md — full fact-check pass
- [ ] CONTEXT.md — verify all features match codebase reality
- [ ] README.md — update for Purdue reviewers
- [ ] Professor README — one-page institutional review doc

#### ⏳ Deferred (post-Purdue)
- Video Generation (HunyuanVideo), Knowledge Tracing (BKT), RLHF fine-tuning
- Bevy WASM `<canvas>` in React (blocked by winit 0.30.13 + Rust 1.94)
